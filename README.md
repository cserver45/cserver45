### Hi there 👋
- I'm currently learning Ruby, and Rust
- I'm very good at Python and fairly good at web development in general.
- I make Discord bots in my free time (made 2 to date)
- Most of the repositories here are small scripts that have helped me greatly, and I hope will help someone else.
- You can reach me via the email on the left
- Any help is greatly apreciated on any of my projects.
